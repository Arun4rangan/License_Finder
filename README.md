It provides the htm files required to decode the lisence key.

To work this program, you must clone this folder and move the files from htm files folders to the main folder. 
Then start the setup.bat, to start the program. It will run through some batch codes, after few seconds, you 
can close it. Then excel file will automatically open, showing you the "lisences" found in each htm 
files. These lisences are edited. You are able to search within the excel file for a specific program.

Thank you!
